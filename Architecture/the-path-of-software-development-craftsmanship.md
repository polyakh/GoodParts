## [The Path of Software Development Craftsmanship](https://dmitripavlutin.com/the-path-of-software-development-craftsmanship/)
You must apply an efficient learning strategy: put accept on programming fundamentals.

The programming fundamentals consist of algorithms, data structures, and programming language knowledge.

If you want to be a great software developer, without doubt, you should constantly master trending technologies (like React, Redux, Angular). 
And in the meantime `put the same amount of effort to learn regularly fundamentals like algorithms, data structures, the principles of writing scaling and clean code`.



To build complex and top quality applications you must have algorithms knowledge.

The quality code consists of an effective algorithm and a convenient data structure.


###  Beginner: the upside-down triangle
For an easier representation lets divide coding abilities into a simplified scheme:
* Fundamentals: everything related to algorithms, data structures, computer science questions, application design principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY, SoC), scalability
* Language: everything related to programming languages (JavaScript, Swift, Java), the syntax, operators, variables, compilers
* Framework: everything related to frameworks (AngularJS, ReactJS, Cocoa Touch) and platforms (Browser, NodeJS).

### Proficient: the rectangle
The proficient developer has mastered well ReactJS framework and JavaScript language. The number of hacks in his code is minimal.
The proficient developer can see the situations when certain data structure or algorithm makes the code more productive. 
But only until a limited level.
For example, an application has a component that searches often in an array with lots of elements. 
If the array is altered rarely, the developer concludes that it is reasonable to sort the array. 
And when a search operation is necessary, use the binary search algorithm, which is very efficient in this situation
